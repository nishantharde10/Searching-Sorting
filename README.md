## 📝 Problems

### Searching Algorithms

1. **Binary Search in a Sorted Array**
   - Given a sorted array, find the index of a target element. If not found, return the index where it should be inserted.
   - [Solution](./problems/BinarySearch.java)

2. **Search Insert Position**
   - Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it should be inserted.
   - [Solution](./problems/SearchInsertPosition.java)

3. **Find First and Last Position of Element**
   - Find the first and last position of a target element in a sorted array. If the target is not present, return [-1, -1].
   - [Solution](./problems/FirstLastPosition.java)

4. **Find Peak Element**
   - Given an array, find the peak element. A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
   - [Solution](./problems/FindPeakElement.java)

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Sort an Array**
   - Implement sorting algorithms to sort an array of integers.
   - [Solution](./problems/SortArray.java)

2. **Kth Largest Element in an Array**
   - Find the Kth largest element in an unsorted array using sorting.
   - [Solution](./problems/KthLargestElement.java)

3. **Merge Intervals**
   - Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
   - [Solution](./problems/MergeIntervals.java)

4. **Largest Number**
   - Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest possible number.
   - [Solution](./problems/LargestNumber.java)
